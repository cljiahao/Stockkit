# accept

## Purpose

The legal-acceptance interstitial a signed-in vendor is redirected to when
their accepted terms/privacy versions are behind `@merqo/ui`'s
`LEGAL_VERSIONS`. stockkit owns no acceptance record — merqo does — so this
folder's job is entirely to collect the vendor's consent and forward it.

## Contents

- `page.tsx` — `LegalAcceptPage`. Reads the `next` search param (through
  `safeRedirectPath`, `@/lib/safe-redirect`) and renders the client form.
  Deliberately runs no legal-gate check itself — it is what the gate
  redirects to, so gating it would loop.
- `accept-form.tsx` — `AcceptForm`, a client component wrapping `@merqo/ui`'s
  `TermsAcceptanceCheckbox` (checkbox + legal-name field); the submit button
  is disabled until both are filled. Posts to `acceptLegalTerms`.
- `actions.ts` — `acceptLegalTerms` server action. Re-checks for a signed-in
  user (redirects to `/login` otherwise), reads+trims `legal_name` from the
  submitted `FormData` (throws if empty — the real trust boundary, not the
  client-side disabled submit button), then `POST`s
  `/api/merqo/legal-accept` on merqo once per doc type (`terms`, `privacy`),
  each independent so a duplicate-acceptance conflict on one never blocks
  the other. On success it primes the local `legal_check_state` cache and
  redirects to a `safeRedirectPath`-checked `next` (default `/dashboard`).
- `actions.test.ts` — covers the two independent posts, the cache prime,
  `next`-param safety, the no-user/missing-secret/missing-`legal_name`
  branches, and a non-2xx throw.
