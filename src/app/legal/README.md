# legal

## Purpose

The public legal-document pages and the acceptance interstitial. Content lives
in `@merqo/ui` (one source, shared by merqo and every kit); stockkit only
routes to it and, on `accept/`, records the vendor's acceptance with merqo.

## Contents

- `terms/page.tsx` — `TermsPage`, a one-line Server Component rendering
  `@merqo/ui`'s `<LegalDocument doc="terms" />` (the component brings its own
  `mx-auto max-w-3xl` prose container, so there's no local layout).
- `privacy/page.tsx` — `PrivacyPage`, the same for `<LegalDocument doc="privacy" />`.
- `accept/page.tsx` — `LegalAcceptPage`. The interstitial
  `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`'s inline `requireCurrentLegalAcceptance` call
  (`@/lib/legal-gate`) redirects a signed-in vendor to when their accepted
  terms/privacy versions are behind `@merqo/ui`'s `LEGAL_VERSIONS`. Reads the
  `next` search param (through `safeRedirectPath`, `@/lib/safe-redirect`) and
  renders the client form. Deliberately runs **no** legal-gate check itself —
  it is what the gate redirects to, so gating it would loop.
- `accept/accept-form.tsx` — `AcceptForm`, a client component wrapping
  `@merqo/ui`'s `TermsAcceptanceCheckbox` (checkbox + legal-name field); the
  submit button is disabled until both are filled. Posts to `acceptLegalTerms`.
- `accept/actions.ts` — `acceptLegalTerms` server action. Re-checks for a
  signed-in user (redirects to `/login` otherwise), reads+trims `legal_name`
  from the submitted `FormData` (throws if empty — the real trust boundary,
  the client-side disabled submit button is not), then `POST`s
  `/api/merqo/legal-accept` on merqo once per doc type (`terms`, `privacy`) —
  bearer-authed with `MERQO_CUSTOMER_SECRET`, `kit_slug: "stockkit"`, each
  body carrying the SHA-256 of that doc's `getLegalDocSource(...)` plus
  `legal_name` and the vendor's real `ip`/`user_agent` (read via
  `headers()`/a local `clientIp` helper — stockkit has no shared rate-limit
  module to reuse — since this action runs on the vendor's own browser
  submission). Each call is independent, and merqo maps a duplicate `(email,
  doc_type, doc_version)` to a success, so a conflict on one doc never blocks
  the other. On success it primes the local `legal_check_state` cache to
  `is_current = true` and redirects to a `safeRedirectPath`-checked `next`
  (default `/dashboard`).
- `accept/actions.test.ts` — covers the two independent posts (asserting
  `legal_name`/`ip`/`user_agent` land in both bodies), the cache prime,
  `next`-param safety (absolute / protocol-relative rejected), the no-user,
  missing-secret, and missing/whitespace-only `legal_name` branches, and a
  non-2xx throw.

## Connectivity

stockkit owns no acceptance record — merqo does (`merqo.legal_acceptances`).
The gate that sends vendors here lives in `@/lib/legal-gate`
(`requireCurrentLegalAcceptance`), called inline from
`src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` right after its own `/login` check — stockkit
has no shared vendor-gate helper (unlike qkit/loopkit/paykit), so the layout
is the one real entry point. `terms/` and `privacy/` are also linked from the
site footer (`@merqo/ui`'s `LegalFooterLinks` in
`src/components/layout/site-footer.tsx`).
