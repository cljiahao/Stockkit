-- Local TTL cache for "has this email's legal-doc acceptance been confirmed
-- current recently?". stockkit does not own the acceptance record — merqo
-- does (merqo.legal_acceptances) — so confirming currency means an HTTP call
-- to merqo's GET /api/merqo/legal-status. That check runs on every gated
-- dashboard render, so the result is cached here for a short TTL, mirroring
-- merqo's own vendor_sync_state throttle table.
--
-- Written and read only by the service-role client (src/lib/legal-gate.ts);
-- never reached from a browser path, so it follows the same RLS-on /
-- no-client-policy / explicit-service_role-grant shape as admin_audit (0013)
-- and every other service-role-only table in this schema.
