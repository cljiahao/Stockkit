# hooks

## Purpose

The scripts `.claude/settings.json` wires to Claude Code lifecycle events —
the actual guardrail logic (secret/CI protection, commit hygiene, type
feedback, prompt-injection screening, skill-usage logging) behind the
harness.

## Contents

- `block-no-verify.sh` — PreToolUse(Bash): blocks `--no-verify`/`-n` on
  `git commit`, `HUSKY=0`/`HUSKY_SKIP_HOOKS`/`core.hooksPath=` bypasses,
  direct commits to `main`, force-push to a protected branch,
  `git checkout/restore` on guard-layer files, and recursive-force `rm` on
  source directories; exit 2 blocks.
- `post-edit-typecheck.sh` — PostToolUse(Edit|Write), `.ts`/`.tsx` files
  only: runs incremental `tsc --noEmit` and surfaces the last 5 lines;
  feedback-only, never blocks.
- `post-edit-comment-check.sh` — PostToolUse(Edit|Write), `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.js`/
  `.jsx`/`.mjs`/`.cjs` files: flags change-narration comments (patterns from
  `../comment-hygiene-patterns.txt`, e.g. a comment starting "Changed" or
  "Added") and oversized comment blocks (>5 consecutive `//` lines) via
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`; feedback-only, never blocks.
- `post-tool-failure.sh` — PostToolUseFailure: writes the failed tool's
  name/error to stderr so the model can self-correct; always exits 0.
- `protect-files.sh` — PreToolUse(Edit|Write): hard-blocks (exit 2) writes
  to `.env*` (except `.env.example`/`.env.default`), CI/CD pipeline files,
  secrets directories, and cert/credential files; asks for human approval
  on other protected files (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/CONSTITUTION.md`,
  `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/hooks/*`, `.claude/agents/*`,
  `.mcp.json`, the harness manifest/verifier/regen scripts, `Dockerfile`,
  `.husky/*`/`.gitleaks.toml`).
- `session-context.sh` — SessionStart(startup|resume|clear|compact):
  re-injects the first 30 lines of `AGENTS.md` and a fixed list of
  always-on invariants (secrets guard, quality gate, feature-branch rule,
  protected files, architecture boundaries).
- `skill-usage-log.sh` — PostToolUse(`Skill__.*`): appends a
  `timestamp\tskill-name` line to `.claude/skill-usage.log`; always exits 0;
  the data source for a future skill-usage audit.
- `stop-checks.sh` — Stop: runs `pnpm test`; on failure, tails the last 20
  lines to stderr and exits 2 to force a fix before the turn ends;
  short-circuits to exit 0 when `stop_hook_active` is true, avoiding a
  re-entry loop.
- `subagent-stop.sh` — SubagentStop: if a subagent left uncommitted
  `.ts`/`.tsx` changes (working tree or staged), runs `tsc --noEmit` and
  exits 2 with the last 20 lines of errors, blocking a handback of broken
  code.
- `user-prompt-guard.cjs` — UserPromptSubmit: OWASP LLM01 prompt-injection
  phrase guard (e.g. "ignore previous instructions") plus LLM02
  credential-leak detection (AWS keys, GitHub PATs, Anthropic API keys, PEM
  private-key blocks, DB/broker URLs with embedded credentials); exit 2
  blocks.

## Connectivity

Every script here is inert on its own — `.claude/settings.json` is what
binds a script to a lifecycle event (matcher + command), and that binding
is what makes it a "hook" rather than a loose shell script. Most scripts
read the tool-call JSON from stdin (via an inline Node one-liner) to pull
`tool_input.file_path`/`command`/`prompt`; exit code conventions are
consistent across the set — `exit 2` blocks/forces a fix (stderr surfaces
to the model), a `permissionDecision: "ask"` JSON payload on stdout with
`exit 0` requires human approval, plain `exit 0` allows. `verify-harness.sh`
(one level up, in `.claude/`) treats every script in this folder as part of
the integrity-checked enforcement layer.
